# ChatRoom
A simple chat room server and client written in java where clients can send a message to all the other clients connected to the server.

Be sure to change the IP address of where the server listens on, and the IP address to which the client connects. Currently, the IP address for both is set to run on the same machine (localhost).

This implementation includes a graphical user interface for the pleasure of the user.
